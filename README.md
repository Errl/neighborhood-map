Project 5 for Udacity Front-end Nanodegree

This is a neighborhood map of the Downtown New York City area. The map is pre-populated with various important locations. There is a search bar with auto-complete from google places. Instead of using the search results from Google places, I chose to use Google Maps textSearch. I found this combination of using the Places auto-complete with the Maps textSearch gave me the best results. The search is run on both Google Maps and Skoot, a third party api I use for local deals. I purposely chose to use a seperate filter box to filter all results, as I liked the returned results better.
